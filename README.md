# JDUA
JavaFX Disk Usage Analyzer

This is the Initial release of the JDUA. It is a semester project for CEN4020: Software Engineering 1, under the group Renegade Hackers.

The 3 people involved in Renegade Hackers are Ronald Ramos, Emerson Small and myself. Ronald attempted to write his own code to fufill the functional requirements we set out for this project but due to time constraints I had to override his code and implement outside patterns and rimplement an outside library in order to meet deadlines; so 100% of the present code is written, tested and maintained by myself.

If time permitts, I will try to maintain this project. This code is free and open source if anyone wants to fork it or do whatever one desires to do with it go ahead.

The whole purpose of this code is to emulate WinDirStat on multiple platforms, in its current state it works on Windows, OSX, Linux and any other Operating System that supports Java v1.8.
